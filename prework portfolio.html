                 <h1>(Introduction)</h1>
                 <strong> I wanted to become a software engineer because:</strong>
                 <p>Hello Everybody, I never thought once that I would be in school to study to become a software
                    engineer (i.e web developer) but here I am getting my education. My life
                    has always been up and down and I could never  find my nitch. I got my degree at 16
                    to become a nurse. Then I studied acting and Wholesale real estate.
                    I landed my first official TV role as a pro wrestler on "Women Who Wrestle" but ended up in 
                    a terrible motorcycle accident causing me to be handicapped for about 3 years.
                    As I laid in bed I had to figure out a solution for my life. That's when I discovered FOREX.
                    I became an instructor within 4 months of my learning curve and helped those to make money
                    on my forex signals. I doubled my account in months and thought i'd be a millionaire by the time I turned 22. 
                    Unfortunatley that didn't happen because of all the responsibilities they handed me when 
                    I joined a forex company. I figured if I could create a BOT or an algo that can send me signals while
                    I'm handling other priorities, then I could become instanty profitabe again. I wrote my algo ideas
                    and they stole it while using a dedicated engineer. I figured it's time I take matters into my own hands. Learn how to code myself
                    so I don't need to find a software engineer who can later steal my ideas. 
                    Even though this journey will be very challenging. I cannot give up. I'm excited to learn 
                learn new skills and become one of the BEST engineers.
